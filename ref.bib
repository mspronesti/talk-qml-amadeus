	data based on already classified training examples. In this
	work, we show that the support vector machine, an optimized
	binary classifier, can be implemented on a quantum computer,
	with complexity logarithmic in the size of the vectors and
	the number of training examples. In cases when classical
	sampling algorithms require polynomial time, an exponential
	speed-up is obtained. At the core of this quantum big data
	algorithm is a non-sparse matrix exponentiation technique
	for efficiently performing a matrix inversion of the
	training data inner-product (kernel) matrix.",
